# RTC2
RTC2 stands for "Reverse Tunnel C2" because it is a command and control server that utilises [ngrok](https://ngrok.io) to do reverse port forwarding.
This also lets all communication happen via https for extra security. As well as this, all communication is encrypted with private/public key pairs.
